    <h2>What is ForumCompass?</h2>
        <p>ForumCompass is a political compass test that measures 3 axes of political ideals within the Caiti Forums. Those 3 axes are Authority vs. Liberty, Government intervention in activity, and Progressivism vs. Conservatism. You will be presented by a statement, and then you will answer with your opinion on the statement, from <b>Strongly Agree</b> to <b>Strongly Disagree</b>, with each answer slightly affecting your scores. At the end of the quiz, your answers will be displayed on a Forum political compass.<br /><br />
        * The questions were written entirely by me, and I had to think of the same amount of questions as the original test, so some may be somewhat dumb.<br /><br />
        There are <b><u><span id="numOfQuestions"></span></u></b> questions in the test.</p>
    <script type="application/javascript" src="questions.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var questionCount = 0;
        for (var i = 0; i < questions.length; i++) {
            for (var j = 0; j < questions[j].length; j++) {
                questionCount = questionCount + questions[i][j].length;
            }
        }
        document.getElementById("numOfQuestions").innerHTML = questionCount;
        window.onload = function() {
            var background = new Image();
            background.onload = function() {
                var c = document.createElement("canvas");
                c.width = 1850;
                c.height = 1300;
                var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
                ctx.fillStyle = "#EEEEEE"
                ctx.fillRect(0, 0, 1850, 1300);
                ctx.drawImage(background, 0, 0);
    
                document.getElementById("banner").src = c.toDataURL();
            }
